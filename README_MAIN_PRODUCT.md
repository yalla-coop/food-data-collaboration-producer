# Food Data Collaboration

## Product Vision

*In this section, we will delve into the core of our product - its vision, objectives, audience, stakeholders, and budget.*

**Client summary**

The [UK Food Data Collaboration](https://fooddatacollaboration.org.uk/) is a project to integrate UK short supply chain food distribution platforms with the [Data Food Consortium](https://www.datafoodconsortium.org/en/) (DFC) Ontology, creating a UK Local Food Data Commons. The project is being hosted by the [Open Food Network UK](https://openfoodnetwork.org.uk/) and is funded by [The National Lottery Community Fund](https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/).

See the [Technical partner tendering document](https://fooddatacollaboration.org.uk/work-with-us/) available on their website for more context.

**Vision Statement**

The ultimate goal of this product is to facilitate the wholesale and re-sale of [agroecologically](https://www.fao.org/agroecology/overview/overview10elements/en/) produced and harvested products, bridging the gap between consumers and producers, for a more sustainable planet.

**Key Objectives**

Key objectives and deliverables for this project are:

- Provide a custom made Shopify app for producers, that allows them to
    - Select which of their products should be sold via the Food Data Collaboration network
    - Map retail and trade variants
    - Receive wholesale orders from hubs
- Provide a custom made Shopify app for hubs, that allows them to
    - Connect to a producer’s store by authenticating on the OIDC server of Les Communs
    - Create a sales session
    - Add to their store any of the products / variant mappings previously made available by the producer
    - Enable them to edit the retail - wholesale markup to maximise profits
 - Create a platform-agnostic API that enables authenticated users to read and write Shopify product and order data by transforming the data model into the DFC-based ontology.

The apps are currently deployed on Jelastic Cloud and we only support the connection between one Producer and one Hub.

**Target Audience**

The main users of this product are Hub managers, who are small producers or small stores that wish to re-sell products of local wholesale suppliers.

The secondary users are Producers, who can choose which products to make available to the Hubs.

Lastly, we have end customers, who will be purchasing from the Hub online stores. They won’t be involved with the whole logic of the apps but they expect a seamless purchasing experience.

```
**Explanation:**

_Shopify App:_
This represents the Shopify application developed

_GitHub (Source Code):_
The source code of the Shopify application is maintained in a GitHub repository.

_GitHub Actions:_
A GitHub Actions workflow is configured to automate the build and deployment process.
When code is pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions will trigger a workflow to build the application and create Docker images for the application.

_Docker Containers:_
The application is containerized using Docker, creating an application container.
Similarly, the database is also containerized, creating a database container.

_Jelastic Cloud:_
The final stage involves deploying the Docker containers to the Jelastic Cloud.
GitHub Actions handles the deployment process, ensuring the latest version of the application and database are running in the cloud environment.

This pipeline ensures that any code changes pushed to the GitHub repository are automatically built, tested, and deployed to the Jelastic Cloud, providing a streamlined and efficient deployment process.

## Product Playbook

### Navigating the tool/website

Once the Hub and/or the Producer have installed their related apps, they will see them on Shopify in the left side panel in the “Apps” section.

The Hub needs to be authenticated against Les Communs to be able to use the custom built food-hub app.

### Key Features - Producer

**Hub Users**
Producers can manage access for reselling their products by approving or rejecting requests from potential resellers. They also have the ability to remove existing users from the reseller list.

**Products**
- A comprehensive list of all products currently in the Producer’s Shopify inventory, featuring checkboxes to enable or disable each product for the FDC Network.
- Each product can be mapped from a retail variant to a wholesale variant (e.g., Apple Balsamic Vinegar, Retail bottle, 100ml → Apple Balsamic Vinegar, Small case, 6x100ml).
- During the mapping process, Producers must specify the conversion ratio (e.g., 1 Small case = 6 Retail bottles).
- For every enabled product, the following details will be shared with the Hub: name, description, quantities, images, and variants.
- Note: There is a disable variant mapping mode which means that Producers can choose to map a variant to itself with a 1:1 ratio.

For every enabled product, we will share its details with the Hub. Details include name, description, quantities, images and variants.


### Key Features - Hub

**Sales Sessions**
- Purpose: Sales Sessions are essential for Hubs to sell the Producer’s products on their store. They also signal to the system when all orders received by the Hub are finalized and ready for the Producer to process.
- Creation: Users must specify a start and end date when creating a Sales Session.
- Automatic Renewal: Once the Sales Session’s end date is reached, the session is automatically terminated, and a new session of equal length is created by the system.

**Product List**
The Product List is the most important feature of the app. It includes only the products that the Producer has selected to be sold via the FDC Network.

<img width="892" alt="Bildschirmfoto 2024-08-06 um 10 05 44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f36763b-33ad-4b1d-b4fe-03c89250957e">

_On this page, Hub managers can:_
- Select which products they want to sell in their stores.
- Adjust the product price by applying a markup, which will be reflected in their store.
    - Note: Prices cannot be changed during an active Sales Session.
- View the number of configured variants for each product at a glance.

**Orders Flow between the Hub and the Producer**

The system follows a structured process for managing orders between the Hub and the Producer. The workflow is as follows:

_Initiating a Sales Session:_
At the start of a new Sales Session, the system generates an empty draft order on the Producer side. This draft order serves as a grouped order, ready to receive multiple line item updates.

_Updating the Draft Order:_
As sub-orders are received during the Sales Session, the system updates the draft order with the relevant line items. These updates can include adding new line items or canceling existing ones.

_Processing Internal Excess Stock:_
Before placing new orders with the Producer, the system first processes any available internal excess stock at the Hub. This ensures that existing inventory is utilized efficiently before additional orders are created.

_Completing the Sales Session:_
When the Sales Session concludes, the system finalizes the draft order. This completion moves the order to the Producer’s orders tab, marked as 'payment pending' and 'unfulfilled'. The Producer can then proceed with managing the fulfillment of the Sales Session order according to their procedures.


### Using the Tool

Here you can find some test scenarios to be performed in the indicated order, which will guide you through using the tool: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KwBg_uWBoqTWc7kjxfuR0Tw88OzeIYk3w8V1KtpoSS4/edit?usp=sharing

**Tips + best practices for using the tool**

When testing this for the first time, or if it’s required to have a clean slate, it’s very useful to follow these steps:

1. Hub manager:
    - End the active sales session (if applicable)
    - Clear all Shopify products (default Shopify functionality)
    - Log out from https://login.lescommuns.org/auth/realms/data-food-consortium/account/#/
3. Producer:
    - Delete Hub's user account
4. Hub manager:
    - Go to the food-hub app and login again with your OICD details
